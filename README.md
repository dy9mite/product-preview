# product-preview
A mobile product preview created with HTML and CSS
This is a challenge from Frontend Mentor [https://www.frontendmentor.io]
I used Semantic HTML to structured my document 
Then I add stylings using CSS
For CSS I used Flexbox and Pseudo selectors
I coded it with Visual Studio (VS) code
